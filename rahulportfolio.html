    <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;ABOUT:-</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gardening is my favourite hobby. I own a small plot of land next to our house. I cultivate gardening there. Every day, I spend half an hour gardening. After returning from my morning walk, I go to my garden with a spade and a bucket of water. I prepare the soil, prune the plants, and water them. I also use insecticides and fertilisers. My heart leaps with joy when I see the plants swaying in the wind. I feel heavenly pleasure as I watch them grow day by day.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family is where you learn your first life lessons. Your family members are the only assets that will always be with you. Whatever the circumstances, family members are always there to support one another. In a family, good values and morals are always instilled. We are prepared in the family to respect our elders and love our children. Our family consistently teaches us lessons about honesty, dependability, kindness, and so on. Family always gives us the feeling of being loved and cared for.</p>
